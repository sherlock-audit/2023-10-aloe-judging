# Oracle.sol: observe function has overflow risk and should cast to uint256 like Uniswap V3 does
## Summary
The `Oracle.observe` function basically uses the same math from the Uniswap V3 code to search for observations.  

In comparison to Uniswap V3, the `Oracle.observe` function takes a `seed` such that the runtime of the function can be decreased by calculating the `seed` off-chain to act as a hint for finding the observation.  

In the process of copying the Uniswap V3 code, a `uint256` cast has been forgotten which introduces a risk of intermediate overflow in the `Oracle.observe` function.  

Thereby the `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` return value can be wrong which can corrupt the implied volatility (ÃŒV) calculation.  

## Vulnerability Detail
Looking at the `Oracle.observe` function, the `secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` return value is calculated as follows:

https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/libraries/Oracle.sol#L196
```solidity
liqCumL + uint160(((liqCumR - liqCumL) * delta) / denom)
```

The calculation is done in an `unchecked` block. `liqCumR` and `liqCumL` have type `uint160`.  
`delta` and `denom` have type `uint56`.  

Let's compare this to the Uniswap V3 code.

https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/Oracle.sol#L279-L284
```solidity
beforeOrAt.secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128 +
    uint160(
        (uint256(
            atOrAfter.secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128 - beforeOrAt.secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128
        ) * targetDelta) / observationTimeDelta
    )
```

The result of `atOrAfter.secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128 - beforeOrAt.secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128` is cast to `uint256`.  

That's because multiplying the result by `targetDelta` can overflow the `uint160` type.  

The maximum value of `uint160` is roughly `1.5e48`.  

`delta` is simply the time difference between `timeL` and `target` in seconds.  

The `secondsPerLiquidityCumulative` values are accumulators that are calculated as follows:
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/Oracle.sol#L41-L42
```solidity
secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128: last.secondsPerLiquidityCumulativeX128 +
    ((uint160(delta) << 128) / (liquidity > 0 ? liquidity : 1)),
```

If `liquidity` is very low and the time difference between observations is very big (hours to days), this can lead to the intermediate overflow in the `Oracle` library, such that the `secondsPerLiquidityCumulative` is much smaller than it should be.  

The lowest value for the above division is `1`. In that case the accumulator grows by `2^128` (`~3.4e38`) every second.

If observations are apart 24 hours (`86400 seconds`), this can lead to an overflow:
Assume for simplicity `target - timeL = timeR - timeL`
```text
(liqCumR - liqCumL) * delta = 3.4e38 * 86400 * 86400 > 1.5e48`
```

## Impact
The corrupted return value affects the [`Volatility` library](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/libraries/Volatility.sol#L121). Specifically, the IV calculation.    

This can lead to wrong IV updates and LTV ratios that do not reflect the true IV, making the application more prone to bad debt or reducing capital efficiency.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Perform the same cast to `uint256` that Uniswap V3 performs:  
```solidity
liqCumL + uint160((uint256(liqCumR - liqCumL) * delta) / denom)
```
