# Dos attack on `enrollCourier()` function
## Summary
 The id is of type uint32, and a security concern arises from the fact that malicious actors can repeatedly call this function,gradually consuming the available id values until the upper limit is reached.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `Factory.enrollCourier()` function is used to register new couriers in the system.
```solidity
function enrollCourier(uint32 id, uint16 cut) external {
        // Requirements:
        // - `id != 0` because 0 is reserved as the no-courier case
        // - `cut != 0 && cut < 10_000` just means between 0 and 100%
        require(id != 0 && cut != 0 && cut < 10_000);
        // Once an `id` has been enrolled, its info can't be changed
        require(couriers[id].cut == 0);

        couriers[id] = Courier(msg.sender, cut);
        isCourier[msg.sender] = true;

        emit EnrollCourier(id, msg.sender, cut);
    }

```
 The id is of type uint32, and a security concern arises from the fact that malicious actors can repeatedly call this function, gradually consuming the available id values until the upper limit is reached. Once the upper limit is reached, the function becomes inoperable and unable to register any more couriers.

## Impact
This issue can result in a system where no new couriers can be registered, potentially causing disruptions in the system's functionality and rendering the enrollCourier function useless.
