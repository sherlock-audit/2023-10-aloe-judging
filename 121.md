# Race condition in lender shares
## Summary
The tokenized share for lenders has a race condition issue. Upon examining the code, it's evident that couriers have an allowance to deposit on behalf of users. Malicious couriers can potentially frontrun the approval transaction and deposit double the amount on behalf of the users. Moreover, the token does not adhere to the ERC4626-ERC20 standard, as it lacks the increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance methods.
## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose Alice approves Bob for 100 * 1e18 Lender share tokens using the approve method inside the Lender contract. Later, Alice realizes she actually needed to approve 200 * 1e18 tokens to Bob, so she initiates another transaction with the adjusted approval amount. Bob, acting quickly, spends the initial 100 * 1e18 tokens. However, by the time Alice's second transaction is mined, Bob still has an allowance of 200 * 1e18.

## Impact
The Lender contracts are not erc4626-erc20 standard and the front-running is exists for p2p lender token approvals
