# Borrowers can't close their position with exact amount of repayment due.
## Summary
In `Lender.sol` function `repay()` is used to repay the amount of borrowed debt and due to a condition check in the if block `if (!(units < b))` borrowers who want to repay full amount won't be able to repay full amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the repay() function b=1 signifies whitelisting as per the docs `the first unit is used for whitelisting; it's not real debt.` 
further the mapping `borrows[beneficiary]` tracks the borrows of the borrower and it is stored in `b` and later the amount is converted into units as per the formula in the code 
```solidity
units = (amount * BORROWS_SCALER) / cache.borrowIndex;
```
now the problem is if the user tries to repay with the exact amount of debt which is when converted into units the `units will be equal to b` i.e. `units = b` and the if condition in the code doesn't account for the equality condition it only lets the user pay with the units that must be strictly less than b

```solidity
 if (!(units < b))
 ```
 
 This condition won't let user repay their exact amount of borrowed debt.

## Impact
Borrowers can't literally close their position with complete amount of repayment due.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function repay(uint256 amount, address beneficiary) external returns (uint256 units) {
        uint256 b = borrows[beneficiary];

        // Accrue interest and update reserves
        (Cache memory cache, ) = _load();

        unchecked {
            // Convert `amount` to `units`
            units = (amount * BORROWS_SCALER) / cache.borrowIndex;
            if (!(units < b)) {
                units = b - 1;

                uint256 maxRepay = (units * cache.borrowIndex).unsafeDivUp(BORROWS_SCALER);
                require(b > 1 && amount <= maxRepay, "Aloe: repay too much");
            }

            // Track borrows
            borrows[beneficiary] = b - units;
            cache.borrowBase -= units;
        }
        // Assume tokens are transferred
        cache.lastBalance += amount;

        // Save state to storage (thus far, only mappings have been updated, so we must address everything else)
        _save(cache, /* didChangeBorrowBase: */ true);

        // Ensure tokens are transferred
        require(cache.lastBalance <= asset().balanceOf(address(this)), "Aloe: insufficient pre-pay");

        emit Repay(msg.sender, beneficiary, amount, units);
    }
```

```solidity
 if (!(units < b)) {
                units = b - 1;

                uint256 maxRepay = (units * cache.borrowIndex).unsafeDivUp(BORROWS_SCALER);
                require(b > 1 && amount <= maxRepay, "Aloe: repay too much");
            }
```

## Recommendation
Change the if condition from ` if (!(units < b))` to ` if (!(units <= b))
