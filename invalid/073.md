# Borrower.sol: Two minutes grace period is too short and can lead to unintended liquidations
## Summary
The [`Borrower.warn`](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/Borrower.sol#L148-L173) function is used to warn the borrower that they're about to be liquidated.  

Liquidators earn a 5% incentive when they need to execute swaps to perform the liquidation. The warning is a time delay to allow borrowers to make their account healthy such that they don't have to pay the 5% incentive.  

The time that borrowers have to react to the warning is a hardcoded constant which is set to [2 minutes](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/libraries/constants/Constants.sol#L90-L92).  

The issue is that this duration is too short, especially in times of high network activity, and leads to unexpected liquidations for borrowers that rely on this warning mechanism.  

## Vulnerability Detail
Liquidations that include a swap require that the [`unleashTime` has passed](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/Borrower.sol#L252-L254). This is the time that is set in the `Borrower.warn` function.  

One of the delay's purposes (apart from making liquidations manipulation-resistant) is to allow the borrower some time to react to an upcoming liquidation such that he does not have to pay the 5% liquidation incentive.  

As described above, the delay is a constant 2 minutes.  

This is not enough time considering that the borrower needs to run a bot that monitors for the `Warn` event being emitted and then needs to send his transaction to the network to be executed before the two minutes pass.  

In times of high network activity, it is likely that transactions take longer to execute unless the borrower massively overpays in Gas fees and even then it is not clear which is the Gas amount that is sufficient to have the transaction executed in time.  

Also, periods with high network congestion go hand in hand with periods of high market volatility. 
This means there is a high likelihood that due to high volatility, a lot of loans will go bad in these periods of network congestion.

## Impact
The liquidation warning mechanism doesn't give borrowers enough time to react to pending liquidations, leading to a loss the size of the incentive (5% of the swap volume).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `LIQUIDATOIN_GRACE_PERIOD` constant should be increased to a more reasonable value that gives borrowers a more realistic chance to react to upcoming liquidations and have their transaction executed in time.  

A reasonable value range is 10-20 minutes.  

We do not have to worry about bed debt being created in case there's a sudden market movement within this grace period. That's because the IV calculation should allow for a 24 hour period in which only a 4 to 8 sigma event would cause bad debt.  

So the change from 2 minutes to 10 minutes or 20 minutes doesn't notably increase the risk of bad debt.  

The maximum interest that can accrue in a 20 minute period is `((1 + 706354 / 1e12) ** (24 * 60 * 60)) - 1 = ~0.085%` which means the `MAX_LEVERAGE` constant doesn't need to be updated. Interest from the grace period cannot create bad debt.
