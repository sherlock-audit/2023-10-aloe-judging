# Precision loss in Ledger.sol
## Summary

Precision loss vulnerability detected in the calculation of inventory within the Ledger smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The inventory calculation in the Ledger contract (found on line 207) involves integer division that can lead to significant precision loss under certain scenarios. Specifically, when the product of borrowBase and borrowIndex is divided by BORROWS_SCALER, any fractional results from this division operation are truncated, potentially leading to unintended inaccuracies in the determined inventory.

## Impact

Economic Impact: Users interacting with the contract could face discrepancies in their calculated balances, possibly leading to financial losses.

Operational Inefficiencies: Over time and with multiple transactions, the cumulative effect of this precision loss might lead to systemic imbalances within the contract's state.

## Code Snippe

```solidity
function underlyingBalanceStored(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
    unchecked {
        // @follow-up unchecked -> can thishave precission lose
        uint256 inventory = lastBalance + (uint256(borrowBase) * borrowIndex) / BORROWS_SCALER;
        uint256 totalSupply_ = totalSupply;

        return _convertToAssets(_nominalShares(account, inventory, totalSupply_), inventory, totalSupply_, false);
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Utilize Fixed-Point Arithmetic Libraries: Libraries such as ABDK Math 64.64 or similar can provide fixed-point arithmetic operations, which can help maintain precision throughout computations.
