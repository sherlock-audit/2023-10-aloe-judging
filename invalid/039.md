# Lender.sol: Using non-zero ERC20 allowance to set the courier allows for privilege escalation
## Summary
The `allowance` mapping in `Ledger.sol` is used to manage the ERC20 allowances for the ERC20 share tokens.

However, `Lender.deposit` also uses the allowance check to allow someone to set a courier. This allows for a privilege escalation. 

When Alice gives Bob a non-zero allowance, she's granting him the privilege to set the courier for her address.
As a consequence Bob can prevent Alice from transferring her `Lender.sol` tokens (an address with a courier cannot transfer shares), and Bob can set himself as a courier for Alice with a very high courier cut, e.g. 99.99%.

Thereby the impact that Bob has on Alice's shares is not limited to whatever his allowance is. The interest that he can earn from being Alice's courier can far exceed the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's imagine a scenario of Alice giving some allowance of `Lender.sol` to Bob through the `Lender.approve` function. 
Her intention is to allow Bob to use her tokens according to the allowance value she has given.

She is unaware that Bob can use this allowance to set himself as a courier for her, with a very high courier cut, e.g. 99.99%, eating a large portion of her earned interest. Also Bob, by setting himself as a courier for Alice, [blacklists Alice from transferring her `Lender.sol` tokens](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/Lender.sol#L412).
The precondition for this to occur is that Alice's balance of `Lender.sol` is zero. This can occur before Alice's first deposit or after she has redeemed all her funds and perhaps makes another deposit in the future. 

The steps for Bob taking advantage of the given allowance are the following:

1. Bob invokes `Factory.enrollCourier` and registers himself as a courier with a very high courier cut, e.g. 99.99%.
2. Bob invokes `Lender.deposit` with Alice as beneficiary, his id as `courierId` and an arbitrary amount. 
3. Bob's `courierId` is [written to the balances mapping](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/Lender.sol#L454).
4. Alice has to pay a high courier fee each time she's burning her `Lender.sol` tokens, since she's stuck with Bob as her courier.
5. Also, Alice can no longer transfer her `Lender.sol` tokens since [transfers are disabled](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/Lender.sol#L412). 

## Impact
Any address to whom a user has given any allowance of `Lender.sol` is granted the privilege to set the `courier` for the user and to thereby affect the user's balance by more than the given allowance. Also by setting a courier, the user can be blacklisted  from transferring his `Lender.sol` share tokens in the future.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The ability to set the courier should not be managed together with the ERC20 allowance. These are two different privileges that need to be kept separate.
