# The reserveFactor is loaded from storage in the same slot as rateModel. A malicious contract could exploit this to manipulate values.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The reserveFactor can be manipulated due to being loaded from storage in the same slot as rateModel. Here is how it works:
In the _previewInterest() function, this line loads both reserveFactor and rateModel from storage at the same time:

       uint8 rf = reserveFactor; 
       uint256 accrualFactor = rateModel.getAccrualFactor({...});

A malicious rateModel contract could manipulate the reserveFactor value when it is loaded by implementing getAccrualFactor() to modify storage.
For example:

      function getAccrualFactor(Data memory data) external view returns (uint256) {
        // Set reserveFactor to 0 before it is read
        reserveFactor = 0;

        // Return a normal accrualFactor
       }

This would allow the attacker to set reserveFactor to 0 when it is loaded, reducing the protocol's revenue.

## Impact
The main issue is that loading the reserveFactor and rateModel from the same storage slot opens up the contract to manipulation. Specifically:
• A malicious rateModel contract could overwrite the reserveFactor value in storage when rateModel.getAccrualFactor() is called. This would allow the attacker to set reserveFactor to 0, reducing the protocol's revenue.
• Conversely, changes to reserveFactor could overwrite the rateModel address in storage. This could brick lending/borrowing or redirect interest payments.
So the severity is high - this issue compromises critical parameters and could lead to loss of revenue or denial of service.
The impact is that core protocol revenue and interest rate logic can be hijacked. This breaks the fundamental lending/borrowing mechanisms.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 This, reserveFactor should be loaded separately from rateModel to prevent manipulation:

       uint8 rf = reserveFactor; 

       uint256 accrualFactor = IRateModel(rateModel).getAccrualFactor({...});

By interacting with rateModel via an interface rather than directly, its code cannot manipulate reserveFactor when it is loaded.
