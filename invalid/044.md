# Lender.sol#DOMAIN_SEPARATOR - Risk of reuse of signatures across forks due to lack of chainID validation
## Summary
Making use of `block.chainid` in `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` can lead to replay attack in course of an hard fork on a chain
## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, there is no specification for how chain ID is set for a particular network, relying on choices made manually by the client implementers and the chain community.
In the advent of an hard fork:
There are two potential resolutions in this scenario under the current process: 
1) one chain decides to modify their value of chain ID (while the other keeps it), or 
2) both chains decide to modify their value of chain ID.

And this can lead to replay attack on both forks
## Impact
Bob signs a permiter on the Ethereum mainnet. He signs the domain separator with a
signature to permit a permit someone to spend his shares. Later, Ethereum is hard-forked and retains the same chain ID. As a
result, there are two parallel chains with the same chain ID, and Eve can use Bobâ€™s
signature to transfer the `shares` on the forked chain.
