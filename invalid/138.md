# Burning 100% of the shares will result in a 0 fee being paid to the courier.
## Summary
Burning 100% of the shares will result in a 0 fee being taken in the _burn() function.
## Vulnerability Detail
burning 100% of the shares will result in a 0 fee being paid to the courier.
Here is the relevant code from the _burn() function:

       uint256 fee = ((balance - principleShares) * cut) / 10_000;
       balance -= fee; 

       fee = (fee * shares) / balance;

When burning 100% of the shares, shares == balance. So the second line simplifies to:
fee = (fee * balance) / balance
Which results in fee being set to 0, since anything divided by itself is 1.
This is a vulnerability because it allows the user to avoid paying the courier fee if they burn exactly 100% of their shares. The courier provides value by referring users, so they should be compensated

To buttress my point again in details explaining with relevant code:

      uint256 fee = ((balance - principleShares) * cut) / 10_000;
      balance -= fee;  
      fee = (fee * shares) / balance;

When burning 100% of the shares:
• shares = balance
• So the first line calculates the fee based on (balance - principleShares)
• The second line subtracts this fee from the balance
• The third line then calculates the portion of the fee to transfer based on the shares being burnt (which is now the full balance)
• So shares = balance, which means:
• fee = (fee * balance) / balance
• This results in fee being set to 0

The impact is that when burning 100% of the shares, no fee will be transferred to the courier. This means the courier could miss out on fees in this scenario.

## Impact
This is a vulnerability because it allows the user to avoid paying the courier fee when burning 100% of their shares. The courier who brought in the funds gets cheated out of their fee.

Manual Review

## Recommendation 

To mitigate this, the fee calculation could be changed to:

      uint256 fee = ((balance - principleShares) * cut) / 10_000;

      if (shares == balance) {
        fee = (balance * cut) / 10_000; 
      } else {
        fee = (fee * shares) / balance;
      }

      balance -= fee;

Now if 100% of shares are being burned, the fee is calculated based on the full balance, ensuring the courier gets their cut
