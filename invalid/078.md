# `approve()` function has in-front problem
## Summary

`approve()` function has in-front problem

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint256 shares) external returns (bool) {//@audit
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = shares;

        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, shares);

        return true;
    }
```

## Impact

The `Lender`  just like the ERC20 token, could use transfer/transferfrom/approve

Assume the following scenario:

1. Alice approves Bob’s 10 tokens
2. After a while, Alice changed her mind and wanted to change it to 5 tokens.
3. Bob sees that Alice has changed her mind, so he executes transferfrom 10 to his own account through a front-running attack.
4. When Alice’s approve 5 is executed, Bob has the approves of 5 tokens again.
5. In the end, Alice only approved 5 tokens, but Bob was able to transfer 15 tokens

## Recommendation

Add check in the approve() function if user has approved the value of `Lender`
