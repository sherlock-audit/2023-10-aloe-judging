# `approve()` and `transferFrom()` functions of Pool tokens are subject to front-run attack
## Summary
`approve()` and `transferFrom()` functions of Pool tokens are subject to front-run attack because the approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. In case the spender spent the amonut, the approve function will approve a new amount.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `approve()` method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. It allows the spender to front-run and spend the amount before the new allowance is set.

Scenario:

Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's tokens (N>0) by calling the pool.approve method, passing the Bob's address and N as the method arguments
After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the pool.approve method again, this time passing the Bob's address and M as the method arguments
Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the pool.transferFrom method to transfer N Alice's tokens somewhere
If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M tokens
Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the pool.transferFrom method again, this time to transfer M Alice's tokens.
So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.

## Impact
It can result in losing pool tokens of users when he approve pool tokens to any malicious account.

## Recommendation
Use increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance instead of approve as OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. Please see details here:
