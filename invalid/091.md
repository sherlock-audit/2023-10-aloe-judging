# VolatilityOracle skips implied volatility updates due to time constraints
## Summary
The [`VolatilityOracle.update`](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/VolatilityOracle.sol#L45-L94) function is supposed to be called by external parties to update the implied volatility (IV).  

The problem is that the time constraints for this function are set up in a way that can lead to much less frequent IV updates, making IV react slower to sudden changes in market volatility.  

## Vulnerability Detail
`VolatilityOracle.update` can only update IV [once an hour](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/VolatilityOracle.sol#L56-L58). If the hour hasn't passed, the old IV is returned.  

Note that it's not realistic that there is an exact difference of one hour between IV updates because there may not be a transaction at exactly the hour mark.  

So in reality this will be something like 60-70 minutes *if* there is really an interested party around to call this function for which there is no monetary incentive to do so.

In order to update IV, we need to [find a timestamp](https://github.com/aloelabs/aloe-ii/blob/c71e7b0cfdec830b1f054486dfe9d58ce407c7a4/core/src/VolatilityOracle.sol#L72-L78) from a past update that is `FEE_GROWTH_AVG_WINDOW - FEE_GROWTH_SAMPLE_PERIOD / 2` (5.5 hours) to `FEE_GROWTH_AVG_WINDOW + FEE_GROWTH_SAMPLE_PERIOD / 2` (6.5 hours) seconds in the past.  

If we can't find that, IV won't be updated. The new `LastWrite` is created though and the `feeGrowthGlobals` array is updated. At this point we need to wait another hour to try to make an IV update, even though IV hasn't even been updated (this means we skip an IV update).  

If we make a reasonable assumption that it takes 5 minutes for someone to call `VolatilityOracle.update` after it becomes possible again then there is a `5 / 65 = ~7%` chance that we don't find a timestamp that is close enough and we skip an update. For a 10 minute delay, the chance is `10 / 65 = ~15%`  

Thereby IV can in fact react slower than it is supposed to.

## Impact
IV is updated less often than it should due to the 1 hour restriction for making updates to the `feeGrowthGlobals` array.  

Thereby IV reacts slower to sudden changes leading to an increased risk of bad debt or decreased capital efficiency.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The solution is to allow updating the `feeGrowthGlobals` array more frequently than after `FEE_GROWTH_SAMPLE_PERIOD` seconds.  

I recommend `FEE_GROWTH_SAMPLE_PERIOD / 2`, i.e. 30 minutes.  

Still only update the IV once an hour and since the `feeGrowthGlobals` array is updated more frequently, it will always be possible to make an IV update (even when there is a delay for updating the `feeGrowthGlobals` array) as opposed to skipping some updates.
