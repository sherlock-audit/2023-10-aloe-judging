# Borrower.sol - Lack of access control
## Summary
The comments above this code specifies that these functions can only be called by the owner of the borrower contract but they lack access control
## Vulnerability Detail
Based on context, `Borrower.transfer`, `Borrower.withdrawAnte`, `Borrower.rescue ` , `Borrower.repay` and `Borrower.uniswapWithdraw`  should be accessible by the owner only.

However they all lack access control in the current implementation.
## Impact
Anyone can call this functions especially `Borrower.withdrawAnte` and `Borrower.rescue `  which can lead to lose of funds
