# No access control
## Summary

There is missing an access control mechanism in the pause fucntion of the Factory.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Factory.sol the pause function (in the emergency category) is an external function and it is missing access control like a modifier for who can call the function.While it may be rather unlikely that someone finds the the oracleseed and the pool interface ,incase it happens a malicious user could be able to pause any pool he finds out.

## Impact

As stated before this is an unlikely event but if it happens and a malicious user can pause any pool it will have an impact on how the protocol works and also on the trust users have in the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add either a modifier that allows certain users to call the function or add specific roles and require that only those specific roles can call the function using a require statement.
