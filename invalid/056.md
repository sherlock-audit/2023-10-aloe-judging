# One Wallet Can Control All Courier Ids
## Summary
The function enrollCourier allows anyone to enroll themselves in the referral program Aloe provides. This function fails to check if the msg.sender already has a Courier Id so it is possible for one wallet to enroll itself at every Courier Id, except 0. This essentially bricks the referral program and to unknowing uses may even lead to a loss of reward interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is nothing in the enrollCourier function that disallows one wallet registering as a courier at different or all ids.

## Impact
This renders the referral program useless and to users unaware of the situation could lead to them differing all their accrued interest to the malicious Courier if they set the cut to 10_000 on each id

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function test_canEnrollSameAddressAtDiffIds() external {
        vm.startPrank(address(12345));
        factory.enrollCourier(1, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(2, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(3, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(4, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(5, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(6, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(7, 5000);

        factory.enrollCourier(8, 5000);
        
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        (address courier, uint16 cut) = factory.couriers(1);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(2);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(3);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(4);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(5);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(6);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(7);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(8);
        assertEq(courier, address(12345));

        (courier, cut) = factory.couriers(9);
        assertEq(courier, address(0));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Only allow an address to enroll as a Courier once.
2. Implement a limit on the number of Courier IDs that can be registered by a single address to prevent monopolization of the referral program.
3. Create an administrative function to revoke or reassign Courier IDs in case of malicious activity, which would add a layer of control to manage the referral program effectively.
