# `poolState.lastUpdated` doesnt get updated after accumalating rewards
## Summary
after accumalting rewards,  poolState.lastUpdated never gets updated to show when last rewards were accumulated
## Vulnerability Detail
in Rewards.sol there is a function call `_accumulate` which is used to Accumulates rewards based on the current `rate` and time elapsed since last update, according to the comments. this would mean that every time `_accumulate` is called, the `poolState.lastUpdated` which is part of the poolState struct, should be updated as well because it clearly states 'Last time `accumulated` was updated' in the comments, to mean when poolState.accumulated was last updated.
## Impact
the longer it takes to update `poolState.lastUpdated` then the bigger the rewards accrued which could mess with the accounting as it used in getting userState.earned
