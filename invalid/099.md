# Using block.timestamp as deadline on increase liquidity  transaction can allow the transaction to be mined a later time.
## Summary
Uniswap Transactions that use `block.timestamp` for deadline can be kept for longer than necessary by the miner until it is profitable to the miner for sandwich attack and cause a loss for the user since `block.timestamp` an never expire but a `literal` value supplied timestamp can expire.

## Vulnerability Detail
increaseLiquidity and decreaseLiquidity functions use `block.timestamp` as `deadline`.
```solidity
 function _withdrawFromUniswapNFT(
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint128 liquidity,
        address recipient
    ) private returns (uint256 burned0, uint256 burned1) {
        (burned0, burned1) = UNISWAP_NFT.decreaseLiquidity(
            IUniswapNFT.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0,
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
...
}
```
## Impact
Loss of funds due to MEV. Miners can wait longer time until its profitable for them and cause a loss to the user.

## Recommendation
Allow users specify a `deadline` timestamp as parameter instead of using `block.timestamp` because `block.timestamp` never expires but a literal timestamp value can expire.
