# Loss of funds due to lack of slippage protection on increaseLiquidity and decreaseLiquidity.
## Summary
The increaseLiquidity and decreaseLiquidity functions have no slippage protection in place because the amount0Min and amount1Min are set to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
Slippage helps protect funds from MEV sandwich attack during  increaseLiquidity and removeliquidity operations and it is ensured with the amountMin values that the user is ready to take.
```solidity
(burned0, burned1) = UNISWAP_NFT.decreaseLiquidity(
            IUniswapNFT.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
                tokenId: tokenId,
                liquidity: liquidity,
                amount0Min: 0,//@audit no slippage protection.
                amount1Min: 0,
                deadline: block.timestamp
            })
        );
```

## Recommendation
Allow `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` as input parameters to allow users specify the minimum amount they are willing to take and not met, the transaction will revert.
