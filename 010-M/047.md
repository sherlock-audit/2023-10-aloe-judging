# No Bad Debt Socialization
## Summary

There is no bad debt socialization in Aloe leading to a race to withdraw if there is a large insolvency.

## Vulnerability Detail

The balances of a vault are stored in state variables that are unaffected by the the `balanceOf` the vault and the borrowers. This works as long as there is no bad debt in the system. It assumes that the underlying balance will always be repaid:

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice The amount of `asset` owed to `account` after accruing the latest interest, i.e.
     * the value that `maxWithdraw` would return if outstanding borrows weren't a constraint.
     * Fees owed to couriers are automatically subtracted from this value in real-time, but couriers
     * themselves won't receive earnings until users `redeem` or `withdraw`.
     * @dev Because of the fees, âˆ‘underlyingBalances != totalAssets
     */
    function underlyingBalance(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
        (, uint256 inventory, uint256 newTotalSupply) = _previewInterest(_getCache());
        return _convertToAssets(_nominalShares(account, inventory, newTotalSupply), inventory, newTotalSupply, false);
    }
```
As shown both in the code and the code comments, the balance accounting used is similar to one used for an ERC4626 vault that accrues interest. This assumes that there will never be a case for assets in the vault to be permanently lost.


If a bad debt event occurs, the accounting still assumes that there will ultimately be enough assets to eventually repay borrowers. This means that when bad debt occurs this creates a race condition. Lenders are incentivised to un-stake early to get their full share of their deposit back, and there would be no ability to pay out later withdrawers.

As demonstrated in other submissions, bad debt events are a possible occurrence.

## Impact

- If bad debt is created in the system, it is not socialized, where early withdrawers get their full deposit + interest/rewards back, while there is not enough funds to pay out later withdrawers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When a position that has not been liquidated and is insolvent, or a liquidation itself causes bad debt, this debt should be socialized and accounted for. This should be deducted from the underlying balance of the shares in the vault.
