# permanent DoS of Courier (Affiliate function)
## Summary

Aloe protocol implements support for a kind of Referral (Affiliate) system. A malicious user can easily DoS this function forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

Refferees are called Courier in Aloe, and they can register as such using the `enrollCourier` function of the Factory.sol contract.

All they have to do, is to call this function with an `id` (uint32) and a `cut` (uint16)  parameter. The cut specifies the percentage of the fees they would receive from referals.

The function has a check if an id is already used, and reverts if this is the case, to prevent overwriting of Couriers.

This, and the fact that the id is stored ad an uint32, makes it relatively easy for an attacker to call the function for every possible Id, and to fill up the whole mapping. This will allow nobody else to ever register as a Courier.

## Impact

- enrollCourier function is DOSed for ever.
- nobody can register as courier.

- add a governance function to delete couriers
