# Lender.sol Failure to comply with the EIP-2612
## Summary
Lender.sol Failure to comply with the EIP-2612
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the README.md

> Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?
The Lender complies with ERC4626 and EIP2612.

> Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base

According to [Eip2612 Doc](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612):
Compliant contracts must implement 3 new functions in addition to EIP-20:
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external
function nonces(address owner) external view returns (uint)
function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() external view returns (bytes32)

The DOMAIN_SEPARATOR should be unique to the contract and chain to prevent replay attacks from other domains.

## Impact
In Lender.sol, there is no implementation of nonces() and DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(). The contract will also be deployed on the mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base chains, which poses a potential replay attack vulnerability.

## Recommendation
Properly implement nonces() and DOMAIN_SEPARATOR().
