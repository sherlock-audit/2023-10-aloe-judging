# Non monoatomic operation issue on `deposit` and `repay` open for user's asset lost
## Summary

user's `deposit()` and `repay()` can be sandwiched due to non-monoatomic transaction when user doing token transfer and deposit (or repay) function call

## Vulnerability Detail

On Lender contract `deposit` function, there is a part where the deposit call check to ensure token are transferred (Line 149-152). This `didPrepay` check if the cached lastBalance less or equal than current asset balance of the Lender contract, while the cache lastBalance already increased by deposit amount on Line 142.

```js
File: Lender.sol
115:     function deposit(uint256 amount, address beneficiary, uint32 courierId) public returns (uint256 shares) {
...
141:         // Assume tokens are transferred
142:         cache.lastBalance += amount;
...
147:         // Ensure tokens are transferred
148:         ERC20 asset_ = asset();
149:         bool didPrepay = cache.lastBalance <= asset_.balanceOf(address(this));
150:         if (!didPrepay) {
151:             asset_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
152:         }
...
155:     }
```

This `didPrepay` is assuming user already send their deposit amount before calling this `deposit()` function, which is open for sandwich / front-run attack.

To be precise, when someone plan to deposit using prepay way, there are 2 transaction the user need to perform.

1. for example a user want to deposit 10 amount of token, they transfer 10 token to the contract,
2. call deposit with amount as 10, in this way, the `didPrepay` will be true, thus skipping the `asset_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)`.

The issue here is, this operation is not monoatomic, means, some attacker can sandwich the transaction, in this case, when that user transfered the 10 token, the attacker can just call deposit and put their beneficiary address as theirs, resulting the user will fail to deposit. Or attacker doesn't have to call deposit, they can just use flashloan `flash()` function, and keep the difference.

the same issue goes to the repay function, where this function assume user already send the token first before calling `repay()`.

```js
File: Lender.sol
257:     function repay(uint256 amount, address beneficiary) external returns (uint256 units) {
...
277:         // Assume tokens are transferred
278:         cache.lastBalance += amount;
279:
280:         // Save state to storage (thus far, only mappings have been updated, so we must address everything else)
281:         _save(cache, /* didChangeBorrowBase: */ true);
282:
283:         // Ensure tokens are transferred
284:         require(cache.lastBalance <= asset().balanceOf(address(this)), "Aloe: insufficient pre-pay");
...
287:     }
```

## Impact

User's deposit or repay token is loss due to attacker snip (sandwiched) the transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revise the logic functions and ensure the token transfered on the same function call (example, using `transferFrom` inside the function)
