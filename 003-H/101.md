# No slippage protection parameters when withdrawing liquidity from a UniswapV3Pool via the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()`, which lead to a sandwich attack and could result in a huge slippage loss
## Summary
There is no slippage protection parameters when withdrawing liquidity from a UniswapV3Pool via the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()`, which lead to a sandwich attack and could result in a huge slippage loss.


## Vulnerability Detail
When a borrower attempt to add liquidity to a Uniswap position, the borrower would call the Borrower#`uniswapWithdraw()` via the Borrower#`modify()`.

WithIn the Borrower#`uniswapWithdraw()`, the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L386
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Allows the `owner()` to withdraw liquidity from one of their Uniswap positions. Only works within
     * the `modify` callback.
     * @dev The `LiquidityAmounts` library can help convert underlying amounts to units of `liquidity`
     * @param lower The tick at the position's lower bound
     * @param upper The tick at the position's upper bound
     * @param liquidity The amount of liquidity to remove, in Uniswap's internal units. Pass 0 to collect
     * fees without burning any liquidity.
     * @param recipient Receives the tokens from Uniswap. Usually the address of this `Borrower` account.
     * @return burned0 The amount of `TOKEN0` that was removed from the Uniswap position
     * @return burned1 The amount of `TOKEN1` that was removed from the Uniswap position
     * @return collected0 Equal to `burned0` plus any earned `TOKEN0` fees that hadn't yet been claimed
     * @return collected1 Equal to `burned1` plus any earned `TOKEN1` fees that hadn't yet been claimed
     */
    function uniswapWithdraw(
        int24 lower,
        int24 upper,
        uint128 liquidity,
        address recipient
    ) external onlyInModifyCallback returns (uint256 burned0, uint256 burned1, uint256 collected0, uint256 collected1) {
        (burned0, burned1, collected0, collected1) = _uniswapWithdraw(lower, upper, liquidity, recipient); ///<---------- @audit
    }
```

WithIn the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()`, the UniswapV3Pool#`burn()` would be called to withdraw the underlying tokens (remove liquidity) from a Uniswap position like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L542
```solidity
    function _uniswapWithdraw(
        int24 lower,
        int24 upper,
        uint128 liquidity,
        address recipient
    ) private returns (uint256 burned0, uint256 burned1, uint256 collected0, uint256 collected1) {
        (burned0, burned1) = UNISWAP_POOL.burn(lower, upper, liquidity); ///<------------------ @audit
        ...
    }
```

According to the [official UniswapV3's documenation](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/providing-liquidity/decrease-liquidity), the parameters for the slippage protection (`amount0Min` and `amount1Min`) would be recommended to prevent from a slippage loss like this:
> In production, `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` should be adjusted to create slippage protections.

However, within the UniswapV3Pool#`burn()` calling inside the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()`, there are no parameters (`amount0Min` and `amount1Min`) for the slippage protection. 

This allow a malicious actor to do front-running and sandwich attack and could result in a huge slippage loss.


## Impact
There is no slippage protection parameters when withdrawing liquidity from a UniswapV3Pool via the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()`, which lead to a sandwich attack and could result in a huge slippage loss.

## Recommendation
WithIn the UniswapV3Pool#`burn()` calling inside the Borrower#`_uniswapWithdraw()`, consider adding the parameters for the slippage protection (`amount0Min` and `amount1Min`).
