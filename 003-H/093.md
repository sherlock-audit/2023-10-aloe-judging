# Lack of the slippage protection parameters when the UniswapV3Pool#`mint()` would be called in the Borrower#`uniswapDeposit()`, which lead to a huge slippage loss
## Summary
Within the UniswapV3Pool#`mint()` calling inside the Borrower#`uniswapDeposit()`, there are no parameters for `minDeposit0` and `minDeposit1`, which are used to prevent slippage. 
This allows malicious users to do a front-running attack (sandwich attack), which lead to that expose to high slippage and could result in a huge slippage loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a borrower attempt to add liquidity to a Uniswap position, the borrower would call the Borrower#`uniswapDeposit()` via the Borrower#`modify()`.

WithIn the Borrower#`uniswapDeposit()`, the UniswapV3Pool#`mint()` would be called to deposit the underlying tokens (add liquidity) into  a Uniswap position like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L363
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Allows the `owner()` to add liquidity to a Uniswap position (or create a new one). Only works
     * within the `modify` callback.
     * @dev The `LiquidityAmounts` library can help convert underlying amounts to units of `liquidity`.
     * NOTE: Depending on your use-case, it may be more gas-efficient to call `UNISWAP_POOL.mint` in your
     * own contract, instead of doing `uniswapDeposit` inside of `modify`'s callback. As long as you set
     * this `Borrower` as the recipient in `UNISWAP_POOL.mint`, the result is the same.
     * @param lower The tick at the position's lower bound
     * @param upper The tick at the position's upper bound
     * @param liquidity The amount of liquidity to add, in Uniswap's internal units
     * @return amount0 The precise amount of `TOKEN0` that went into the Uniswap position
     * @return amount1 The precise amount of `TOKEN1` that went into the Uniswap position
     */
    function uniswapDeposit(
        int24 lower,
        int24 upper,
        uint128 liquidity
    ) external onlyInModifyCallback returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        (amount0, amount1) = UNISWAP_POOL.mint(address(this), lower, upper, liquidity, ""); ///<------------- @audit
    }
```

According to the details of slippage protection when minting on UniswapV3Pool, the parameters for the slippage protection (`minDeposit0` and `minDeposit1`) should be implemented to prevent from a front-running attack like this:
https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/guides/providing-liquidity/mint-a-position#calling-mint
https://uniswapv3book.com/docs/milestone_3/slippage-protection/#slippage-protection-in-minting

However, within the UniswapV3Pool#`mint()` calling inside the Borrower#`uniswapDeposit()`, there are no parameters for the slippage protection (`minDeposit0` and `minDeposit1`).
This allows malicious users to do a front-running attack (sandwich attack).

## Impact
This allows malicious users to do a front-running attack (sandwich attack), which lead to that expose to high slippage and could result in a huge slippage loss.

## Recommendation
WithIn the UniswapV3Pool#`mint()` calling inside the Borrower#`uniswapDeposit()`, consider adding the parameters for the slippage protection (`minDeposit0` and `minDeposit1`).
