# Liquidator could reverse LP sandwich _uniswapWithdraw and easily cause bad debts for Lenders
## Summary
`_uniswapWithdraw` is a function that burns LP tokens but there's no check on min amounts. This could be used by liquidator to extract value from Borrower and cause bad debts for Lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
Reverse LP sandwich are MEV that target LP modifications such as add liquidity and burn liquidity. Explanation is provided in this [medium article](https://medium.com/virtuswap/the-reverse-lp-sandwich-arbitrage-73a081e68f1f).

The process we care about in the [liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L194-L232) function is as follows
1. `_getAssets` -> `_uniswapWithdraw` -> `UNISWAP_POOL.burn`
2. Calculate repayable based on `min(liability, tokenBalance)`

The issue is that the burnt amount is not checked against any baseline. The liquidator and every MEV searcher are trusted to behave in the best interest of the Protocol. But they shouldn't.

The withdrawn asset could be too skewed or too low to cover the whole liabilities. The loser is the Borrower but this loss would easily spread to Lender in the form of bad debt.

This attack could be executed with a single transaction with flash loan
* Deploy Liquidator contract
* Flashloan large amount from a DEX or lending protocol
* Swap to move Uniswap pool tick
* Execute Borrower.liquidate
* Backrun and move uniswap tick to it's appropriate value

## Impact
Sandwich against `_uniswapWithdraw` would cause loss to depositors of Lender contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider comparing `burn+collected` amount against `assets.fluid0C` and `assets.fluid1C` with a slippage percentage like 1%.
