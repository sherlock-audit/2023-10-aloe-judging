# `initialize` can be called multiple times
## Summary
in lender.sol, `initialize` has no access modifier to allow a particular user or check to make sure that it can only be called once.
## Vulnerability Detail
when initializing the contract, certain parameters are set like lastAccrualTime which is inherited from ledger.sol and it is meant to get the block.timestamp when interest was last accrued. however since the function has no way to check if it has already being initialized then interest can never be accrued, or any other functionality this is evident when `flash` is called and `lastAccrualTime` is checked, since its 0 then the function reverts.
## Impact
no flash loans would ever be taken, a denial of service would always happen.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
set initialized to true at the end of the function and use an if statement to check it before initializing the values.
