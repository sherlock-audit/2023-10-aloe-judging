A malicious user could front run this function and get the Lender[] calldata lenders and by inputing his address as a beneficiery it is possible to steal all the rewards from all the lenders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability and prevent unauthorized claims, you should implement access control checks and validation mechanisms within the claimRewards function to ensure that:

1. The sender of the transaction (msg.sender) matches the legitimate beneficiary.
2. Only authorized users can call the function and specify the beneficiary.

By adding these checks, you can prevent front-runners from manipulating the beneficiary address and ensure that the rewards are correctly distributed to the intended recipient.
