# _previewInterest function does not check that accrualFactor is greater than 0 before using it to update borrowIndex. This is highly vulnerable
## Summary
the _previewInterest function does not check that accrualFactor is greater than 0 before using it to update borrowIndex. This could potentially cause major vulnerabilities
## Vulnerability Detail
The key lines are:

       uint256 accrualFactor = rateModel.getAccrualFactor({
         utilization: (1e18 * oldBorrows) / oldInventory,
         dt: block.timestamp - cache.lastAccrualTime
       });

       cache.borrowIndex = (cache.borrowIndex * accrualFactor) / ONE;

If accrualFactor is 0, then cache.borrowIndex will be 0 after this update. This is problematic because borrowIndex tracks the total interest growth on borrows over time. Setting it to 0 would incorrectly reset all interest accrued.
A borrowIndex of 0 could allow borrowers to repay loans that no longer exist, creating a loss for the protocol. Or it could prevent lenders from withdrawing the full value of their deposits.

To buttress more point:

Specifically, if rateModel.getAccrualFactor were to return 0, it would cause borrowIndex to be set to 0 in the line:

       cache.borrowIndex = (cache.borrowIndex * accrualFactor) / ONE;

Setting borrowIndex to 0 could have negative impacts:
• It would effectively wipe out all accumulated interest for borrowers, making their borrows worth nothing. This could benefit borrowers at the expense of lenders.
• It could potentially enable borrowers to withdraw more assets than they deposited if their borrow balance was accumulated at a higher borrowIndex.


## Impact
The vulnerability of not checking that accrualFactor is greater than 0 is that it could allow the borrowIndex to be incorrectly set to 0. This would have a high severity impact:
• It would wipe out all accumulated interest for borrowers, making their borrows worth nothing. This would unfairly benefit borrowers at the expense of lenders.
• It could enable borrowers to withdraw more assets than they deposited if their borrow balance was accumulated at a higher borrowIndex. This would incorrectly drain assets from the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the code should add:

       require(accrualFactor > 0, "Invalid accrual factor");

before updating borrowIndex.
This will revert the transaction if accrualFactor is invalid, preventing the borrowIndex corruption.
