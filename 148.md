# Users who have shares in vaults with lower decimals receive less rewards
## Summary

Users who hold shares in vaults with fewer tokens receive reduced rewards because each Lender's shares have the same decimal precision as the underlying token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol implements a reward system that calculates rewards for shareholders based on their staked amount and duration.

```solidity
userState.earned += uint112((balance * (accumulated - userState.checkpoint)) / 1e16);
```

The issue stems from the decimals of both the vault and the underlying token not being standardized to `1e18`.

```solidity
function _accumulate(PoolState memory poolState) private view returns (uint144) {
	unchecked {
		uint256 deltaT = block.timestamp - poolState.lastUpdated;
		return poolState.accumulated + uint144((1e16 * deltaT * poolState.rate) / exp2(poolState.log2TotalSupply));
	}
}
```

Even though the delta accumulated is multiplied by `1e16`, the `log2TotalSupply` and the `earned` values are in decimals of the underlying token multiplied by `1e16`.

## Impact

Users participating in vaults with underlying tokens of lower precision will receive significantly reduced rewards, resulting in potential loss of earnings.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider standardizing all reward calculations to `1e18` based on the decimals of the underlying token in each vault using the following formula: `accumulated * (10^18 * (1e18 - token.decimals()))`.
