# Lenders will receive less rewards if the rewardToken is fee on transfer token
## Summary
When a reward token is a fee on transfer (FoT) token, lenders may receive fewer rewards than expected when collecting rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function claimRewards(Lender[] calldata lenders, address beneficiary) external returns (uint256 earned) {
        // Couriers cannot claim rewards because the accounting isn't quite correct for them. Specifically, we
        // save gas by omitting a `Rewards.updateUserState` call for the courier in `Lender._burn`
        require(!isCourier[msg.sender]);

        unchecked {
            uint256 count = lenders.length;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                // Make sure it is, in fact, a `Lender`
                require(peer[address(lenders[i])] != address(0));
                earned += lenders[i].claimRewards(msg.sender);
            }
        }

        rewardsToken.safeTransfer(beneficiary, earned);
    }
```

when lender will try to claim the rewards  the rewards are transfered to the  lender usnig 
```solidity
rewardsToken.safeTransfer(beneficiary, earned);
```

where the tokens are transferred as rewardsToken, however it is not determined in the docs if the rewardsToken is a fee on transfer token or not.

But in case it is a fee on transfer token, the actual rewards received by the lender will be less since the claimable amount is `amount`. But this fails on transfer to account since contract has only `amount-fees`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Compute the balance before and after transfer and subtract them to get the real amount.
