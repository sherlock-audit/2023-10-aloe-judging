# Solmate's safeTransferLib does not check if a token address has associated code with it, which may cause loss of funds.
## Summary
The lack of contract existence check upon a transfer can lead to messed accounting and loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a key difference  between the implementations of OZ's `safeERC20` and Solmate's `safeTransferLib`. The latter does not check if the `token` address has associated code with it. This responsibility is delegated to the caller as stated in the NatSpec [documentation](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9) of Solmate's `safeTransferLib`. This can mess up the accounting due to the fact that `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` won't revert if a non-existent token is passed. Consider the following:

 The `GOVERNOR` has the ability to set `rewardsToken` in `Factory`. Because of the following check `address(rewardsToken) == address(0));` it is made clear that this `token` can be set only once. There are no checks implemented if the `token` address actually contains code so what can happen is that the `GOVERNOR` , either by mistake or willingly, can set `rewardsToken` to an address that has no code within it. This will DOS the protocol because as mentioned above `rewardsToken` can be set only once and although it is not actually a `token` transfers will succeed but no `tokens` are being transferred in reality. 

## Impact
Lenders have no incentive to give loans.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Prior to `safeTransfer` or `safeTransferFrom` add code existence checks. Also check the balance before the `transfer` and after to ensure tokens are actually being transfered.
