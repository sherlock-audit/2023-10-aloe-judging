# When the new rate model is set the latest interest is not accrued according to the previous rate model
## Summary
When the new rate model is set the latest interest is not accrued according to the previous rate model which would create an unfair situation for the users. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever there is a change in the interest rate, the interest first accrues from the latest block to the current block for actions such as repay, borrow, deposit, and redeem. However, when a new rate model is set, the most recent interest does not accrue. Instead, it will accrue based on the current rate model, leading to an unfair and inconsistent interest accrual for users.

When the new rate model is set the previous interest is not accrued. 
## Impact
Unfair accrual of the interest. If the new rate model is significantly different and there are many waiting interest to be accrued this can make the previous interest accrue in the rate model which can make the dripping of the interest unfair for th e lenders and borrowers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Accrue the interest before the rate model update via accrueInterest() or the same flywheel with the repay-borrow-deposit-redeem functions (_load() and _save())
