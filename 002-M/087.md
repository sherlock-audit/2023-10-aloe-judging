# Use of address.transfer(...) native function can revert.
## Summary
The Borrower.sol#liquidate(...) function used `payable(address).transfer(...)` native function to transfer ETH to the `callee` which can revert if the `callee` (address) account is a smart contract that uses up more than 2300gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
`address.transfer()` is called with 2300 gas which would revert if the callee is a smart contract account that has a fallback function that has code that uses up more than 2300 gas.
There are 2 instances in the code where address.transfer is used.

## Impact
address.transfer calls  can revert.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
//Borrower.sol#liquidate(...)
283:  payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain);//@audit dont use transfer
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `address.call{value: amount}()` to send ETH instead of address.transfer(...).
