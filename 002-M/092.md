# Due to a gas limit (2300 gas) of the `transfer()` function of Native ETH, the transaction of the `payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain)` in the Borrower#`liquidate()` may be reverted
## Summary
Due to a gas limit (2300 gas) of the `transfer()` function of Native ETH, the transaction of the `payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain)` in the Borrower#`liquidate()` may be reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a liquidator (`callee`) would liquidate a borrower, the liquidator would call the Borrower#`liquidate()`.

Within the Borrower#`liquidate()`, the amount (`address(this).balance / strain`) of NativeETH would be transferred to the liquidator (`callee` who is the `ILiquidator` contract) to cover transaction fees like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L283
```solidity
    /*
     ...
     * @dev As a baseline, `callee` receives `address(this).balance / strain` ETH. This amount is
     * intended to cover transaction fees. If the liquidation involves a swap callback, `callee`
     * receives a 5% bonus denominated in the surplus token. In other words, if the two numeric
     * callback arguments were denominated in the same asset, the first argument would be 5% larger.
     ...
     */
    function liquidate(ILiquidator callee, bytes calldata data, uint256 strain, uint40 oracleSeed) external {
            ...
            if (shouldSwap) { 
                uint256 unleashTime = (slot0_ & SLOT0_MASK_UNLEASH) >> 208;
                require(0 < unleashTime && unleashTime < block.timestamp, "Aloe: grace");

                incentive1 /= strain;
                if (liabilities0 > 0) {
                    // NOTE: This value is not constrained to `TOKEN1.balanceOf(address(this))`, so liquidators
                    // are responsible for setting `strain` such that the transfer doesn't revert. This shouldn't
                    // be an issue unless the borrower has already started accruing bad debt.
                    uint256 available1 = mulDiv128(liabilities0, priceX128) + incentive1;

                    TOKEN1.safeTransfer(address(callee), available1);
                    callee.swap1For0(data, available1, liabilities0);

                    repayable0 += liabilities0;
                } else { /// @audit info - if (liabilities0 <= 0)
                    // NOTE: This value is not constrained to `TOKEN0.balanceOf(address(this))`, so liquidators
                    // are responsible for setting `strain` such that the transfer doesn't revert. This shouldn't
                    // be an issue unless the borrower has already started accruing bad debt.
                    uint256 available0 = Math.mulDiv(liabilities1 + incentive1, Q128, priceX128);

                    TOKEN0.safeTransfer(address(callee), available0);
                    callee.swap0For1(data, available0, liabilities1);

                    repayable1 += liabilities1;
                }
            }
            ...

            _repay(repayable0, repayable1);
            ...
            payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain); ///<--------------------- @audit

        }
```

According to the blog of ConsenSys Diligence, the `transfer()` function of Native ETH would use a fixed amount of gas unit (`2300 gas`) like this:
https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/

On the other hand, if the caller would be a smart contract, it takes more than 2300 gas unit.
Within the Borrower#`liquidate()` above, the caller of the `payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain)` would be the **ILiquidator contract** (`callee`).
This is problematic. Because due to a gas limit (2300 gas) of the `transfer()` function of Native ETH, the transaction of the `payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain)` in the Borrower#`liquidate()` may be reverted.

## Impact
Due to a gas limit (2300 gas) of the `transfer()` function of Native ETH, the transaction of the `payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain)` in the Borrower#`liquidate()` may be reverted.

## Tool used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the Borrower#`liquidate()`, consider replacing the `transfer()` with the **low-level call** like this:
```diff
    function liquidate(ILiquidator callee, bytes calldata data, uint256 strain, uint40 oracleSeed) external {
            ...
+           payable(callee).call{ value: msg.value }(address(this).balance / strain)("");
-           payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain);
            ...
        }
    }
```
