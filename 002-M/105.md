# address.call{value:x}() should be used instead of payable.transfer()
## Summary

The protocol uses Solidity’s transfer() instead of call. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol uses Solidity’s transfer() when transferring ETH to the recipients. This has some notable shortcomings when the recipient is a smart contract, which can render ETH impossible to transfer. Specifically, the transfer will inevitably fail when the smart contract:

- does not implement a payable fallback
- smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units
- smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the call's gas usage above 2300.

Risks of reentrancy stemming from the use of this function can be mitigated by tightly following the "Check-Effects-Interactions" pattern and using OpenZeppelin Contract’s ReentrancyGuard contract.

```solidity
            payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain);
            emit Liquidate(repayable0, repayable1, incentive1, priceX128);
        }
```

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Using low-level call.value(amount) with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin Address.sendValue is advised
