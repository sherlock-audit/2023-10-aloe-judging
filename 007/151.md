# `enrollCourier` lack of share check open for user owning share to loss their reward
## Summary

User's reward may lost due to change status from a regular user (or address) to courier 

## Vulnerability Detail

by design, couriers cannot claim rewards due to accounting issue, as described in the following function:

```js
File: Factory.sol
228:     function claimRewards(Lender[] calldata lenders, address beneficiary) external returns (uint256 earned) {
229:         // Couriers cannot claim rewards because the accounting isn't quite correct for them. Specifically, we
230:         // save gas by omitting a `Rewards.updateUserState` call for the courier in `Lender._burn`
231:         require(!isCourier[msg.sender]);
232: 
233:         unchecked {
234:             uint256 count = lenders.length;
235:             for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
236:                 // Make sure it is, in fact, a `Lender`
237:                 require(peer[address(lenders[i])] != address(0));
238:                 earned += lenders[i].claimRewards(msg.sender);
239:             }
240:         }
241: 
242:         rewardsToken.safeTransfer(beneficiary, earned);
243:     }
```

but in reality, there is open for possibility for a user (or address) who holds shares at somepoint intend to be a couriers. Noted that when they become a courier they can't claim rewards due to accounting issue. But, since they holds a share, before enrolling as Courier, they need be a way to ensure they already claim their rewards. This may seems like a user's mistakes not 'claimRewards' before 

```js
File: Factory.sol
254:     function enrollCourier(uint32 id, uint16 cut) external {
255:         // Requirements:
256:         // - `id != 0` because 0 is reserved as the no-courier case
257:         // - `cut != 0 && cut < 10_000` just means between 0 and 100%
258:         require(id != 0 && cut != 0 && cut < 10_000);
259:         // Once an `id` has been enrolled, its info can't be changed
260:         require(couriers[id].cut == 0);
261: 
262:         couriers[id] = Courier(msg.sender, cut);
263:         isCourier[msg.sender] = true;
264: 
265:         emit EnrollCourier(id, msg.sender, cut);
266:     }
```

In short, when performing `enrollCourier`, the function need to check whether the proposed address holds some shares, if yes, then need to return their reward first before finally assign them as Courier.

## Impact

User's reward may lost due to change status from a regular user (or address) to courier

## Recommendation

Add a check on `enrollCourier` if they have shares, they reward need to be distributed first before changing their status to be a courier

```js
File: Factory.sol
254:     function enrollCourier(uint32 id, uint16 cut) external {

++           // check if they have shares
++           // claim their reward

255:         // Requirements:
256:         // - `id != 0` because 0 is reserved as the no-courier case
257:         // - `cut != 0 && cut < 10_000` just means between 0 and 100%
258:         require(id != 0 && cut != 0 && cut < 10_000);
259:         // Once an `id` has been enrolled, its info can't be changed
260:         require(couriers[id].cut == 0);
261: 
262:         couriers[id] = Courier(msg.sender, cut);
263:         isCourier[msg.sender] = true;
264: 
265:         emit EnrollCourier(id, msg.sender, cut);
266:     }
```
