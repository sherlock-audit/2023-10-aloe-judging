# Accrual factor is not validated to be <= 1. Could be used to manipulate interest in unexpected ways
## Summary
Accrual factor is not validated to be <= 1. Could be used to manipulate interest in unexpected ways
## Vulnerability Detail
This code contains a potential vulnerability where the accrual factor returned by getAccrualFactor could be greater than 1, which could allow interest to accrue faster than expected.

The key lines are:

       function getAccrualFactor(IRateModel rateModel, uint256 utilization, uint256 dt) internal view returns (uint256) {

         // ...

         return _computeAccrualFactor(rate, dt);

       }

       function _computeAccrualFactor(uint256 rate, uint256 dt) private pure returns (uint256) {

         // ...

         return (ONE + rate).rpow(dt, ONE);

       }

The rpow function computes (ONE + rate) ** dt. If rate is very large or dt is very long, this could result in a number greater than 1.

For example, if rate = 0.5% per second (0.005e18) and dt = 1 year (31536000 seconds), the accrual factor would be 1.005 ^ 31536000 = 2.7, which is > 1.

This could allow interest to accrue much faster than expected. For example, if a deposit accrues 2x the expected interest due to this, it could break the protocol's ability to repay lenders.
## Impact
This could allow interest to accrue much faster than expected. For example, if a deposit accrues 2x the expected interest due to this, it could break the protocol's ability to repay lenders.
In general this is a critical severity issue that undermines the core interest mechanics of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this, the accrual factor should be capped at 1. A suggestive example:

       function _computeAccrualFactor(uint256 rate, uint256 dt) private pure returns (uint256) {

         // ...

         uint256 factor = (ONE + rate).rpow(dt, ONE);

         if (factor > ONE) {

           return ONE;

         } else {

           return factor;

          }

       }

This ensures the accrual factor can never exceed 1, preventing the interest manipulation vulnerability.
