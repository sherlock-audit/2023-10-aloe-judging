# The `rewardsToken` cannot be modified once it has been set
## Summary
The function `Factory.governRewardsToken()` restricts the ability to set the rewardsToken to cases where address(rewardsToken) is equal to address(0). If there are security concerns related to the rewardsToken, the protocol won't have the capability to alter it.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `Factory.governRewardsToken()` allows the governor to set the rewards token used within the protocol, but this can only be done once, ensuring that the rewards token remains consistent and cannot be changed again once set.If there are security concerns related to the rewardsToken, the protocol won't have the capability to alter it.
```solidity
    function governRewardsToken(ERC20 rewardsToken_) external {
        require(msg.sender == GOVERNOR && address(rewardsToken) == address(0));
        rewardsToken = rewardsToken_;
    }

```
## Impact
If there are security concerns related to the rewardsToken, the protocol won't have the capability to alter it.
