# Changing `to.onFlashLoan()` to `msg.sender.onFlashLoan() `
## Summary

The existing implementation of the flash function in the protocol is potentially insecure. It allows any address to call the onFlashLoan callback on the recipient's side (to.onFlashLoan()), which can introduce security risks. If a user implements an insecure onFlashLoan function, it can be exploited by anyone, potentially leading to critical vulnerabilities. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Lender.flash()` function is designed to provide a flash loan to a recipient (to) by transferring a specified amount of assets.It calls the onFlashLoan function of the to address.
Currently, the protocol calls the to address's callback function directly within onFlashLoan. This design has a potential security vulnerability.

In this setup, if a user implements their own onFlashLoan function and it happens to be insecure, it could introduce significant security risks. An attacker could exploit this situation.
```solidity
 function flash(uint256 amount, IFlashBorrower to, bytes calldata data) external {
        // Guard against reentrancy
        uint32 lastAccrualTime_ = lastAccrualTime;
        require(lastAccrualTime_ != 0, "Aloe: locked");
        lastAccrualTime = 0;

        ERC20 asset_ = asset();

        uint256 balance = asset_.balanceOf(address(this));
        asset_.safeTransfer(address(to), amount);
        to.onFlashLoan(msg.sender, amount, data);
        require(balance <= asset_.balanceOf(address(this)), "Aloe: insufficient pre-pay");

        lastAccrualTime = lastAccrualTime_;
    }
```
 An analogous incident occurred with the [Primitive ](https://primitivefinance.medium.com/postmortem-on-the-primitive-finance-whitehack-of-february-21st-2021-17446c0f3122)project, specifically with the Uniswap V2 integration (in the uniswapV2Call function). The problem there was that the Primitive Connector code didn't verify the initiator of the flash-swap operation; it merely checked whether the callback came from Uniswap.

To mitigate this security concern, a safer approach would be to follow the [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L808) model, where the protocol calls the msg.sender's callback function, which inherently verifies the initiator of the flash-swap operation. This would help prevent unauthorized or potentially malicious calls to the onFlashLoan function, enhancing the overall security of the protocol.
```solidity
 function flash(
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount0,
        uint256 amount1,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override lock noDelegateCall {
        uint128 _liquidity = liquidity;
        require(_liquidity > 0, 'L');

        uint256 fee0 = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(amount0, fee, 1e6);
        uint256 fee1 = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(amount1, fee, 1e6);
        uint256 balance0Before = balance0();
        uint256 balance1Before = balance1();

        if (amount0 > 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token0, recipient, amount0);
        if (amount1 > 0) TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token1, recipient, amount1);

        IUniswapV3FlashCallback(msg.sender).uniswapV3FlashCallback(fee0, fee1, data);

```
