# `createMarket` function can be Dos
## Summary
The `createMarket` function in the `Factory` contract is vulnerable to frontrunning. A frontrunner can deploy their own market before Alice's transaction is confirmed, causing Alice's transaction to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the deterministic nature of the salt generation Specifically, the salt used for deploying is derived from the `pool` argument, which is publicly accessible. A frontrunner would first monitor the mempool for transactions that call the `createMarket` function. Once they see a transaction that calls the `createMarket` function, they would deploy their own market with the same parameters as Alice's market. Because the frontrunner's market will be deployed before Alice's market, Alice's transaction will revert.


## Impact
The function can be DoS'd everytime someone tries to call it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `msg.sender` to the salt argument passed to `cloneDeterministically`.

```solidity
bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(pool, msg.sender));
```
