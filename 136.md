# The Lender contract is not fully EIP-4626 compliant, leading to confusion when interacting with it
## Summary

The `Lender.sol` contract, which inherits from `Ledger.sol`, does not return true on `supportsInterface(ERC20)`. This issue makes it incompatible with the EIP-4626 specification, potentially causing confusion when other protocols integrate with a `Lender.sol` vault.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Lender.sol` vault contract should be fully EIP-4626 compliant, meeting all aspects of the specification except for one requirement:

> All EIP-4626 tokenized Vaults MUST implement EIP-20 to represent shares.
> 

For the contract to be fully EIP-20 compliant, it should also support ERC20 as per EIP-165, which it currently does not.

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external pure returns (bool) {
	// @audit it will return false on IERC20
	return
		interfaceId == type(IERC165).interfaceId ||
		interfaceId == type(IERC2612).interfaceId ||
		interfaceId == type(IERC4626).interfaceId;
}

```

More information about EIP-165 can be found here:

[[EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)

## Impact

The vault is expected to be fully EIP-4626 compliant, and other protocols integrating with it assume this as well. However, the current state of affairs can lead to confusion and issues during such integrations, potentially resulting in a loss of value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to modify the `supportsInterface()` function in `Ledger.sol` to ensure full EIP-4626 compliance:

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external pure returns (bool) {
	return
		interfaceId == type(IERC20).interfaceId ||
		interfaceId == type(IERC165).interfaceId ||
		interfaceId == type(IERC2612).interfaceId ||
		interfaceId == type(IERC4626).interfaceId;
}

```

These changes will address the issue and align the vault with the EIP-4626 specification.
