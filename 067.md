# Liquidator receives all eth balance of borrower instead of ante
## Summary
Liquidator receives all eth balance of borrower instead of ante
## Vulnerability Detail
When liquidation occurs, then in the end liquidator [receives eth from borrower's balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L283). The amount depends on `strain` param and on borower's balance.

There is a requirement for borrower. In case if he wants to do any operation using `modify` function, then after that operation [he should have at least `ante` on his eth balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L320C71-L320C100). This `ante` is smth like deposit, that user should hold to be able to act. And as you have already seen it's used to pay liquidator.

The problem is that borrower can have much more than `ante` on his balance as he can operate with eth. In that case liquidator will be able to grab whole that amount. 
## Impact
Borrower can loose all eth balance.

## Recommendation
I believe that such payment should be fair for liquidators:

```solidity
(uint208 ante, , , ) = FACTORY.getParameters(UNISWAP_POOL);
payable(callee).transfer(ante / strain);
```
