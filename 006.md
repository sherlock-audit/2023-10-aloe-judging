# Signature malleability issue
## Summary
An attacker can compute another corresponding [v,r,s] that will make this check pass due to the symmetrical nature of the elliptic curve.

## Vulnerability Detail
The elliptic curve used in Ethereum for signatures is symmetrical, hence for every [v,r,s] there exists another [v,r,s] that returns the same valid result. Therefore two valid signatures exist which allows attackers to compute a valid signature without knowing the signer's private key. ecrecover() is vulnerable to signature malleability so it can be dangerous to use it directly.

An attacker can compute another corresponding [v,r,s] that will make this check pass due to the symmetrical nature of the elliptic curve. The easiest way to prevent this issue is to use OpenZeppelin’s [ECDSA.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol) library and reading the comments above ECDSA's tryRecover() function provides very useful information on correctly implementing signature checks to prevent signature malleability vulnerabilities
