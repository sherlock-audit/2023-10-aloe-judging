# DEPOSIT WITH PERMIT CAN BE BROKEN WHEN USING TOKENS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW THE ERC2612 STANDARD
## Summary
Inconsistencies and unexpected behavior when interacting with non-conforming tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `permit()` function from ERC2616 standard is used in `lenders.sol`and it is used in the `depositWithPermit()` function in `Router.sol`,  and proceeds with the assumption that the
operation was successful, without verifying the outcome. However, certain
tokens may not adhere to the IERC20Permit standard. For example, the DAI
Stablecoin utilizes a permit() function that deviates from the reference
implementation. This lack of verification may lead to inconsistencies
and unexpected behavior when interacting with non-conforming tokens.

# `DAI CODE`

```solidity
pragma solidity =0.5.12;

 contract Dai is LibNote {

 // --- Approve by signature ---
 function permit ( address holder , address spender , uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry ,bool allowed , uint8 v , bytes32 r , bytes32 s) external
 {
 bytes32 digest =
 keccak256 ( abi . encodePacked (
 "\ x19 \ x01 " ,
 DOMAIN_SEPARATOR ,
 keccak256 ( abi . encode ( PERMIT_TYPEHASH ,
 holder ,
 spender ,
 nonce ,
 expiry ,
 allowed ))
 ));

 require ( holder != address (0) , " Dai / invalid - address -0 ");
 require ( holder == ecrecover ( digest , v , r , s) , " Dai / invalid
ë - permit ");
 require ( expiry == 0 || now <= expiry , " Dai / permit - expired "
ë );
 require ( nonce == nonces [ holder ]++ , " Dai / invalid - nonce ");
 uint wad = allowed ? uint ( -1) : 0;
 allowance [ holder ][ spender ] = wad ;
 emit Approval ( holder , spender , wad );
 }
 }
```

## Impact
This lack of verification may lead to inconsistencies
and unexpected behavior when interacting with non-conforming tokens

## Recommendation
Add proper verification to the permit() function call. After calling
the permit() function, ensure that the operation was successful before
proceeding with the minting process.

You can also use `safePermit()` instead of `permit()`

Moonwell finance had the same issue and they mitigated it using `safePermit()`
