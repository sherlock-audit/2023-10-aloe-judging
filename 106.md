# Borrower can be his own liquidator
## Summary

A borrower can be his own liquidator

## Vulnerability Detail

In Borrower.sol, anybody can call liquidate to liquidate a user's position, including the borrower. 

```solidity
    function liquidate(ILiquidator callee, bytes calldata data, uint256 strain, uint40 oracleSeed) external {
        uint256 slot0_ = slot0;
        // Essentially `slot0.state == State.Ready`
        require(slot0_ & SLOT0_MASK_STATE == 0);
        slot0 = slot0_ | (uint256(State.Locked) << 248);

        uint256 priceX128;
        uint256 liabilities0;
        uint256 liabilities1;
        uint256 incentive1;
        {
```

This should not be the case. Borrower should not be the liquidator, otherwise the borrower can just liquidate himself to gain the liquidator rewards

## Impact

Borrower will get his own liquidator rewards
