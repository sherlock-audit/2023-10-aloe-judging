# Potential reentrancy vulnerability related to the lastAccrualTime variable.
## Summary
• lastAccrualTime = 0 is meant to lock state and prevent reentrancy
• But this check can be bypassed if lastAccrualTime is manually set to 0 in storage
• An extra check of lastAccrualTime in storage is needed to fully prevent reentrancy

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a potential reentrancy vulnerability here related to the lastAccrualTime variable.
The key parts of the code are:

1.

      function _previewInterest(Cache memory cache) internal view returns (Cache memory, uint256, uint256) {

        require(cache.lastAccrualTime != 0, "Aloe: locked");
  
        // update cache.borrowIndex
  
        cache.lastAccrualTime = 0; // Marks as locked

        return (cache, newInventory, newTotalSupply); 
      }

2.

      function _getCache() private view returns (Cache memory) {
        return Cache(totalSupply, lastBalance, lastAccrualTime, borrowBase, borrowIndex);
      }

The _previewInterest function first checks that lastAccrualTime is not 0, to prevent reentrancy. It then does some calculations to accrue interest and updates cache.borrowIndex.
Finally, it sets cache.lastAccrualTime = 0 before returning. This is meant to mark the state as "locked" to prevent reentrant calls.
However, _getCache just reads from storage to populate the cache. If lastAccrualTime was manually set to 0 in storage, _getCache would return a cache with lastAccrualTime = 0.
This would allow an attacker to bypass the reentrancy check in _previewInterest and call it again, potentially extracting more funds or manipulating state.


## Impact
This would allow an attacker to bypass the reentrancy check in _previewInterest and call it again, potentially extracting more funds or manipulating state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 An additional check should be added in _previewInterest. A suggestive example:

      require(lastAccrualTime != 0, "Aloe: reentrant call");

This would ensure lastAccrualTime is not 0 both in memory and in storage, preventing the reentrancy vulnerability.
