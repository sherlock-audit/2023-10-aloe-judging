# The  `Borrower.liquidate()` function lacks checks for seemsLegit and pausedUntilTime
## Summary
The liquidate function within the protocol lacks essential checks for seemsLegit and pausedUntilTime. The absence of these checks could introduce potential fairness and predictability issues during the liquidation process.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Borrower.liquidate()` function is missing critical checks for seemsLegit and pausedUntilTime. These checks are essential for ensuring the fairness and reliability of the liquidation process. Without these checks, the protocol may not be able to verify the legitimacy of the liquidation at a specific time. Additionally, the absence of the pausedUntilTime check can result in liquidations occurring during unfavorable or unexpected periods, potentially leading to unfair outcomes for users.
```solidity
 function liquidate(ILiquidator callee, bytes calldata data, uint256 strain, uint40 oracleSeed) external {
        uint256 slot0_ = slot0;
        // Essentially `slot0.state == State.Ready`
        require(slot0_ & SLOT0_MASK_STATE == 0);
        slot0 = slot0_ | (uint256(State.Locked) << 248);

        uint256 priceX128;
        uint256 liabilities0;
        uint256 liabilities1;
        uint256 incentive1;
        {
            // Fetch prices from oracle
            (Prices memory prices, ) = getPrices(oracleSeed);
            priceX128 = square(prices.c);
            // Withdraw Uniswap positions while tallying assets
            Assets memory assets = _getAssets(slot0_, prices, true);

```

## Impact
The absence of the pausedUntilTime check can result in liquidations occurring during unfavorable or unexpected periods, potentially leading to unfair outcomes for users.
