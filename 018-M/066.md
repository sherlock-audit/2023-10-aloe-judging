# liquidation can be called even without warn
## Summary
In case if liquidation doesn't need swap, then it can be called even if `warn` was not called before.
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated by `aloe` docs, in case if user's position becomes unhealthy, then he will have 2 minutes period to make it healthy again in case if he would like to avoid any losses.

So first, liquidator should call `Borrower.warn` function, which [will store time, when liquidation can be executed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L171).

If we look into `Borrower.liquidate` implementation, then we will see, that `unleashTime` check [is only done when swap should occur](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L254). In case if no swap will occur, which can be when position still has enough funds to repay(as position can become unhealthy even if it has needed funds to cover liabilities, because of probe prices check), then `warn` will not be checked and liquidator will be able to execute `liquidate` without calling `warn` first. 

Because of that user will not be able to adjust position(as he expects to catch `Warn` event) and liquidator [will get all his eth balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L283) as `strain` will be 1 in this case, believe me.
## Impact
Borrower has no time to adjust position and loses all his eth balance.

## Recommendation
Even if now swap occurs, still check that warn period has passed. Or at least do that in case, if user has balance to cover all liabilities and only allow to do liquidation without warn, when bad debt occured(position is insolvent).
