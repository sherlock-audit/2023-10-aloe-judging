# AloeII code Audit Contest 2023
## Summary
The Protocol of this audit is the AloeII project. AloeII is a a lending and leverage borrowing protocol
for participating in UniswapV3 farming. The scope of this audit only involves the files and contracts in
scope. The audit was carried out using semi-automatic and manual verifications processes, carrying
out the audit in iterative methodology.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Lender contract, the claim rewards function thats
the recommended function for withdrawals and is called in the withdrawal function of lender contract.
The function accepts three function parameters uint256 shares, address recipient, address owner for
the processing of function Logic. However, the uint256 shares variable passed in as the amount that
would be sent to the address recipient from address owner, is not checked to ascertain if the value
passed in to it is in actual fact lower than the address owner remaining balance uint256 allowed =
allowance[owner][msg.sender]; assert(shares < allowed) was not put in place. Means a malicious user
can steal tokens more than the address owner holds at the time.
function redeem(uint256 shares, address recipient, address owner) public returns (uint256 amount) {

if (shares == type(uint256).max) shares = maxRedeem(owner);
1 if (msg.sender != owner) {
2 uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender];
3 if (allowed != type(uint256).max)
4 allowance[owner][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;

A situation the allowed has a value of 200 and the value passed to shares variable is 2000, the calculation would be -1800 but a value less than zero passed to a uint256 becomes negative and the
value of the address owner balance would be increased and the recipient could take as much token as
type(uint256).max can allow. This issue totally throws the integrity of the system into disrepute as its
the same value that is used to Burn shares and track rewards. Also, the same variable is one of those
passed to the _convertToAssets function.

## Code Snippet
Vulnerability:
lender.sol

[function redeem(uint256 shares, address recipient, address owner) public returns (uint256 amount) {

if (shares == type(uint256).max) shares = maxRedeem(owner);
1 if (msg.sender != owner) {
2 uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender];
3 if (allowed != type(uint256).max)
4 allowance[owner][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;]

Suggestion:
Verify and check that the address owner in fact has more than the value passed to the
shares function parameter.
require(allowed > shares, “Aloe: Not Enough Balance”);

## Tool used
slither for static analysis
Remix for code unit testing 
Forge for test and private network test
and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Verify and check that the address owner in fact has more than the value passed to the
shares function parameter. 

require(allowed > shares, “Aloe: Not Enough Balance”);
