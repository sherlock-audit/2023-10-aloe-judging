# Issues would arise as lastBalance or totalSupply hit 2**112
## Summary
There's no cap on total supply or total assets and this would cause a lot of issues when they hit 2**112 which is the max storage allocated for them.

## Vulnerability Detail
`totalSupply` and `lastBalance` are safe cast to uint112 before storing. 
* `totalSupply` is the number of shares in circulation and this value can increase outside of deposit or mints. It is increased by minting shares to reserve when profit is accrued
* `lastBalance` is the asset balance that's tracked
* inventory is a memory variable that's used to track lastBalance + totalBorrowed with interest

It is possible to reach a total supply or lastBalance that's close to or equal to uint112.max during a deposit. And then at a later time, exceed the max because of interest accrual. This could put the contract in a stalemate because of reverts in `_save`. This scenario is more likely with tokens of high decimals such as 27 because 1e27 is less than 5.2 millions away from uint112.max. 

## Impact
Lender could be in stalemate when totalSupply exceeds 2**112 because of interest accrual.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
uint112 is a small amount and there are multiple recommendations
* Use the `maxMint` and check that every mint won't exceed that.
* Use `maxDeposit` but instead of just setting it to `2**96`, use `_convertToAsset(maxMint())`. The extra step is to be fully ERC4626 compliant
* Warn users against using the contract with high decimals or tokens that print trillions. The contract is unsuitable for large amounts.
