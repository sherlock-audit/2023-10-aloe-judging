# There's no remedy for when liquidator manipulates price
## Summary
Borrower checks price manipulation when the owner wants to `modify` the position. However, there's no check on `liquidate` and this could lead to undesired situations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [modify](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L319C13-L322C15), there are 2 checks on price manipulation. It checks if the price `seemsLegit` and whether the pool has been paused in factory.

```solidity
require(
    seemsLegit && (block.timestamp > pausedUntilTime) && (address(this).balance >= ante),
    "Aloe: missing ante / sus price"
);
```

This is to protect lenders from price manipulation by the borrower. However, an attacker could manipulate price so that multiple Borrower contracts become unHealthy. When such happens, the liquidation would be successful and borrowers can't do anything to protect themselves. If borrowers notice this aggression, they can't modify their position and if they pause the pool, it won't affect liquidations.

This is because [liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L206) does not check if price is legit or whether the pool has been paused.

## Impact
Attacker can manipulate price to make multiple Borrowers unHealthy and liquidate them.
