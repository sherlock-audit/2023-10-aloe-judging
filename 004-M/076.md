# In case if pool is paused, then borrower can't avoid liquidation
## Summary
In case if pool is paused, then borrower can't avoid liquidation as his all actions are blocked
## Vulnerability Detail
In case if prices from uniswap seems to be manipulated, then [pool is paused for 30 minutes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Factory.sol#L162).

Once it's done, then borrower [can't do anything using `modify` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L320C32-L320C65). This check is skipped only if borrower has no liabilities.
This means that all funds that are currently in the Borrower contract and in uniswap under Borrower positions are locked.

This becomes a problem for owner of Borrower, when [he is warned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L155-L173) and he now has 2 minutes to adjust his positions. Owner of Borrower can repay directly to the lender contract on behalf of Borrower, but it's possible that Borrower has another strategy to manage such cases and he needs access to his uniswap positions and Borrower's balance to do so.
## Impact
Borrower can't use own funds to make situation better after he is warned and pool is paused.

## Recommendation
I don't know good solution here, as you trying to not allow them to get funds out of contract in case if prices are broken and you can't detect if borrower doesn't try to cheat. But still this can lead to loss for borrower in from of incentive for liquidator.
