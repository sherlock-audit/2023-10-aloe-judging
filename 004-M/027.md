# healthy Borrowers can get liquidated in case of malipulation in oracle
## Summary
There is no pausing mechanism imposed on liquidation while oracle price is manipulated which could lead to unintended liquidation of borrowers
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract Borrower.sol the function liquidate() is using oracle to get the price for liquidation
```solidity

(Prices memory prices, ) = getPrices(oracleSeed);
```
The protocol has the manipulation detection mechanism that detects any manipulation in the prices and in case of manipulation the borrowing is paused but the liquidation and repayment is not paused while this could lead to unexpected behavior and an unexpected liquidation of the borrowers.
## Impact
Borrowers can get liquidated in case of any manipulation in the prices of the pool by a malicious actor
