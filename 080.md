# Courier allowance is dangerous
## Summary
Courier allowance is dangerous as they then have ability to redeem on behalf of user
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to allow courier to deposit on your behalf user should provide allowance for it. While it's [enough to provide 1 wei allowance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L121C47-L121C86) user can be cheated by courier to set bigger allowance. So then, when courier has deposited on behalf of user, this allowance is not cleared.

So next, courier can call `redeem` function [and use old allowance to withdraw funds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L180-L183) to own address.

I believe that this should be medium severity, because it needs user to approve bigger amount of funds to courier.
## Impact
Courier can steal user's funds.

## Recommendation
I believe that current approach is not correct. You should not mix approve with couriers. There should be separate method which allows courier to deposit on your behalf. As another solution, you should clear allowance for courier after the deposit(but still courier can do redeem instead of deposit).
