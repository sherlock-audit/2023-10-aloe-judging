# The metric calculation in consult() is vulnerable to manipulation further back than 2*UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW.
## Summary
The metric calculation in consult() assumes manipulation only happened in the last 2*UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW seconds. An attacker could manipulate further back to evade detection
## Vulnerability Detail
The metric calculation in consult() is vulnerable to manipulation further back than 2*UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW.
Here is how the vulnerability works:
The key part of the metric calculation is:

       // Compute arithmetic mean tick over the interval [-2w, 0)
       int256 meanTick0To2W = (tickCumulatives[2] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int32(UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW * 2);

       // Compute arithmetic mean tick over the interval [-2w, -w]  
       int256 meanTickWTo2W = (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int32(UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW);

       // The metric compares the difference in the above means
       metric = uint56(SoladyMath.dist(meanTick0To2W, meanTickWTo2W));

The key assumption is that only manipulation in the last UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW is reflected in meanTick0To2W.
An attacker could manipulate further back, in the range [-2*UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW, -UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW]. This would affect meanTickWTo2W but NOT meanTick0To2W.
So the difference and metric would be small, evading detection.
The impact is allowing manipulation without detection. An attacker could systematically manipulate in alternating windows to suppress the metric.

## Impact
The effect is that price manipulation attacks could go undetected if the manipulation happened further back than 2*UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW seconds. This could allow attackers to manipulate prices without being caught.
The severity depends on the value of UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW, but I would categorize this as a high severity issue since it

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The metric should compare current values versus a longer historical baseline, rather than just recent windows. A suggestive example:

       // Calculate metric versus 30-day moving average rather than just 2*UNISWAP_AVG_WINDOW
       int256 historicalMeanTick = ...

       metric = uint56(SoladyMath.dist(meanTick0To2W, historicalMeanTick));

This would detect large deviations versus a longer history, making manipulation harder. Other options like expanding the windows, detecting threshold breaches, or adding reference checks could also help strengthen monitoring.
