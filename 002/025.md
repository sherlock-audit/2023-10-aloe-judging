# Borrower will get liquidated for small amount due to inability of repayment through modify() function
## Summary
A borrower uses modify callback to clear the warnings and repay the borrowed amount but they will not be able to do so due to wrong accounting implementation in `Ledger.sol's` `borrowBalanceStored()` function
## Vulnerability Detail

The modify function is accounting for the `liabilities0` and `liabilities1` from the `_getLiabilities()` function 
```solidity
 (uint256 liabilities0, uint256 liabilities1) = _getLiabilities();
```
```solidity
function _getLiabilities() private view returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        amount0 = LENDER0.borrowBalanceStored(address(this));
        amount1 = LENDER1.borrowBalanceStored(address(this));
    }
```
further the `amount0` and `amount1` is taken from the `lender.sol` contract's `borrowBalanceStored()` function which has the flaw in accounting
```solidity
function borrowBalanceStored(address account) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 b = borrows[account];

        unchecked {
            return b > 1 ? ((b - 1) * borrowIndex).unsafeDivUp(BORROWS_SCALER) : 0; 
        }
    }
```
the accounting flaw is in the return statement 
`return b > 1 ? ((b - 1) * borrowIndex).unsafeDivUp(BORROWS_SCALER) : 0;`
In case where `b=1` the value of b will be 0 and so the function `_getLiabilities()` will return the values of `liabilities0` and `liabilities1` as 0 and further affect the logic for the `modify()` fucntion since the condition `if (liabilities0 > 0 || liabilities1 > 0)` will never fulfill.
## Impact
Borrowers will not be able to `repay` from modify callback function
