# Courier is not reset if owner burnt all shares
## Summary
Courier is not reset if owner burnt all shares. Because of that owner can't receive token transfers.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits, or someone deposits on its behalf, then [courier can be provided](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L115C66-L115C75). This courier is going to get some percentage of owner's profit, so [it's stored in the owner's data](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L454). 

When user has courier, then some actions are not allowed for him. For example token transfers. User [can't be source of transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L412) and [can't be recipient of transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L418).

When i asked sponsor have user can remove courier, then he said, that it's enough to burn all your shares.
However, this is not like that. When you burn shares, then courier is not reset even if you withdrawn all balance. If you check `burn` function, then you will see, that [courier info is not touched](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L473-L534).

When all balance is withdrawn, then [you have ability to change courier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Lender.sol#L453-L456), but only when you mint new shares.

This is incorrect behaviour and it will block user from receiving tokens, once he had withdrawn all shares. In order to be able to receive them he will need to mint some shares and set courier as 0.
## Impact
User's courier is not reset, when he withdrawn everything.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `_burn` function remove courier if user's balance is 0. Or provide additional function that allows to change courier, when you have 0 balance.
