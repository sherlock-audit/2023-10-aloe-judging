# Fees unclaimed by a soon-to-be courier will become stuck
## Summary

Unclaimed rewards of users, who become couriers will get permanently stuck

## Vulnerability Detail

Users can become couriers by invoking `enrollCourier()` and earn a percentage of shares from referred users.

The problem stems from these users' fees not being explicitly claimed upon becoming couriers. If a user has unclaimed fees and becomes a courier, those fees will become permanently locked since couriers are not permitted to claim rewards.

```solidity
function claimRewards(Lender[] calldata lenders, address beneficiary) external returns (uint256 earned) {
	require(!isCourier[msg.sender]);
	
	// ... 
}
```

## Impact

Unclaimed fees of users who become couriers will get permanently stuck.
