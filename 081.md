# Missing deadline and deadline checker on Liquidation function might cause certain inefficiencies on Ethereum Mainnet
## Summary
When liquidating, quantity of assets returned from uniswap depends on price and network congestion is an issue on Ethereum Network
## Vulnerability Detail

On Ethereum Network, network congestion can cause the liquidation tx to be pending and this can cause certain inefficiencies for liquidators.

Like
 1. A liquidator can see a liquidation opportuinity and call the liquidate() function to liquidate the borrower but the liquidation tx could be pending in the mempool due to network congestion and the price of assets may turn to favor the borrower's positions (i.e he starts making profit) and the liquidator loses His liquidation opportuinity.

2. In the case where prices move too quickly if the liquidation tx is executed immediately but left pending in the mempool, borrower may start accruing bad debt.

3. when the liquidation tx is pending in the mempool, liquidators will have to pay costly gas fees than they normally should for the tx to get the miners attention
