# Lender.sol#deposit - User can mint shares without depositing the underlying asset
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`deposit()` requires the user to transfer an amount of the underlying asset to get shares but in the implementation, the `_mint()` comes before the transfer which can cause user/attacker to mint shares with zero assets in their wallet. which he can then call `redeem()` and claim some free assets for himself.
## Impact
Attacker can mint new shares for free thereby undermining the next set of depositors

## Recommendation
rewrite the `deposit()` to first transfer the assets before calling `_mint` or use Solmate ERC4626 implementation contract
