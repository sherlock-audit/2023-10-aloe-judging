# Governor could prevent users from claiming rewards by setting a token address that has no code as `rewardsToken`
## Summary
Factory.governRewardsToken() does not check the code size of the token address set by the governor

## Vulnerability Detail
**Is the admin/owner of the protocol/contracts TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?**

Restricted. The governor address should not be able to steal funds or prevent users from withdrawing.....

 checking the contest page  i see that the protocol is concerned about the governor address stealing user's funds or preventing users from withdrawing.
 
 There is one way the governor could prevent users from claiming rewards.
 
 The governor could do this by setting a token address that has no code as `rewardsToken`, hence it will never be possible for users to claim rewards via Factory.claimRewards(). 

## Impact
Governor could prevent users from claiming rewards by setting a token address that has no code as `rewardsToken`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a code existence check to Factory.governRewardsToken() to ensure the governor doesn't update `rewardsToken` with a malicious token
