# Zero transaction Status Verification After Fund Transfer
## Summary
The contract contains a vulnerability related to the absence of verification for the success or failure of a fund transfer operation. This vulnerability can lead to potential issues when transferring funds, such as not handling failed transfers correctly.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the contract's `liquidate` function, the code contains a transfer of funds to the callee address, but it lacks proper verification of the transaction status:
```solidity
payable(callee).transfer(address(this).balance / strain);
```
The `transfer` function sends Ether from the contract's balance to the `callee` address. However, it does not check whether the transfer was successful or if there was an exception (e.g., due to an out-of-gas error). Without this verification, there is no assurance that the funds were received by `callee`.
## Impact
 If the transfer fails due to unforeseen circumstances, such as running out of gas, the contract will not be aware of this failure. As a result, funds could be lost, and the contract's state may become inconsistent.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's essential to check for the success or failure of the transfer. If the transfer fails, it can lead to a loss of funds or, in the case of liquidation, a lack of incentive for the liquidator. 
```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(callee).call{value: incentiveAmount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
```
