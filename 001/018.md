# Withdrawing ante can fail due to use of `transfer()` on address payable
## Summary
Borrower.sol  uses .transfer() while withdrawing ante and to send ante to `owner()`, the `ante` received is in `ether`. There are a number of issues with using .transfer(), as it can fail for a number of reasons (specified in the Proof of Concept).
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function withdrawAnte(address payable recipient) external onlyInModifyCallback {
        // WARNING: External call to user-specified address
        recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
```

the above code  uses transfer to send eth and it can fail because of various reasons given below :

 1) The destination is a smart contract that doesn’t implement a `payable` function or it implements a `payable` function but that function uses more than `2300` gas units.
2) The destination is a smart contract that doesn’t implement a `payable` `fallback` function or it implements a `payable` `fallback` function but that function uses more than 2300 gas units.
3) The destination is a smart contract but that smart contract is called via an intermediate proxy contract increasing the case requirements to more than 2300 gas units. A further example of unknown destination complexity is that of a multisig wallet that as part of its operation uses more than 2300 gas units.
4) Future changes or forks in Ethereum result in higher gas fees than transfer provides. The .transfer() creates a hard dependency on 2300 gas units being appropriate now and into the future.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L434

```solidity
function withdrawAnte(address payable recipient) external onlyInModifyCallback {
        // WARNING: External call to user-specified address
        recipient.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead use the `.call()` function to transfer ether and avoid some of the limitations of `.transfer()`

```solidity
(bool success, ) = payable(recipient).call{value: address(this).balance}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed.");
```
