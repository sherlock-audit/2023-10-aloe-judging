# Borrower.liquidate can revert if liqudators need more than 2300 gas to hadle payment
## Summary
To send eth fees to the liquidator, `Borrower.liquidate` function [uses `transfer` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-aloe/blob/main/aloe-ii/core/src/Borrower.sol#L283), which only provides 2300 gas with the call. In case if liquidator contract has `receive` function that needs more amount of gas to handle payment, then this call will revert and liquidation will revert as well.
